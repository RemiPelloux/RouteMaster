# RouteMaster

RouteMaster is a powerful routing library for TypeScript applications. It provides named routes, URL generation, reverse routing, route matching, middleware support, and integration with popular Node.js frameworks like Express.js, Koa.js, and Hapi.js.

## Features

- **Named Routes**: Define names for your routes and refer to them throughout your application.
- **URL Generation**: Generate URLs given a route name and a set of parameters.
- **Reverse Routing**: Generate URLs based on route names and parameters instead of hard-coding URLs.
- **Route Matching**: Match a given URL to a route, checking if the URL matches the route's pattern and extracting parameters.
- **Middleware Support**: Attach middleware to routes, implementing features like authentication, authorization, and input validation.
- **Framework Integration**: Integrate with popular Node.js frameworks like Express.js, Koa.js, and Hapi.js.
- **Strong TypeScript Support**: Enjoy strong TypeScript support including type-safe parameters and middleware.
